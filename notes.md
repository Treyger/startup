## Github and web programming essentials ##
i learned a repository is essentially a coding project. Using github is a way for your code to be public, to be stored somewhere that doesn't rely just on a computer, anyone can work on it and request changes or alternate versions (branches), and version histories are kept
VSStudio visualizes everything that happens in the TERMINAL without having to type commands for every action you want to take
pulling gets the current version, pushing suggests changes, committing makes changes, you can create "branches" which are just temporary versions where you can try new code, 
## Startup ##
I learned how to use markdown, how to **bold,** _italicize,_ ~~strikethrough~~, etc.

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.
