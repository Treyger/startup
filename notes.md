## Github and web programming essentials ##
i learned a repository is essentially a coding project. Using github is a way for your code to be public, to be stored somewhere that doesn't rely just on a computer, anyone can work on it and request changes or alternate versions (branches), and version histories are kept
VSStudio visualizes everything that happens in the TERMINAL without having to type commands for every action you want to take
pulling gets the current version, pushing suggests changes, committing makes changes, you can create "branches" which are just temporary versions where you can try new code, 
## Startup ##
I learned how to use markdown, how to **bold,** _italicize,_ ~~strikethrough~~, etc.
