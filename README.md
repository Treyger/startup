### Elevator pitch

The main function of website is a typing game where you have to type a random word displayed underneath a bomb to prevent it from blowing up. Your score will be kept and the game will continue to give you words until you mistype or are too slow. It will have a login feature and the high scores of other players displayed on a leaderboard. The words will be pulled from a random word list.
